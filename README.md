# heart-disease-risk-analysis-python
A data science project applying clustering and classification models to predict heart disease risk using synthetic health data (70,000 samples).

# Heart Disease Risk Analysis

This project predicts the risk of heart disease using machine learning models. It uses a dataset of 70,000 synthetic patient records and applies clustering and classification to discover patterns and assess risk.

## 📊 Project Goals
- Analyze health data to find key symptoms and risk factors
- Engineer new features (e.g., symptom and risk factor counts)
- Use clustering (K-Means) to group patients by health profiles
- Build and evaluate classification models: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📁 Files Included
- `Heart_Disease_Risk_Analysis_Python.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full code
- `Heart_Disease_Risk_Analysis_Python.pdf` – Final project write-up

## 🧠 Model Results
- **Logistic Regression**: 99.1% accuracy | AUC: 0.999
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: 99.1% accuracy | AUC: 0.999
- **Random Forest**: 99.3% accuracy | AUC: 0.999
